# Silicon Valley’s gender gap is the result of computer-game marketing 20 years ago

- tech fields are male dominated but it hasn't always been so.
- through the 1970 and into the 1980s, women in computer science were on their way to parity with men.  This trend reversed by the mid 1980s
- a major factor in the current male dominated tech fields is the fact that major marketing efforts in video games aimed at boys starting in the 1980s.
- this led to a generation women being left out of tech.  Interest in tech became male dominated thanks to this video game marketing.  

# Diversity in tech

This is an informative graphic.  The only companies that have gender parity employees are Indiego and Pandora.  There are several that are at least in the 40s for women employees.  NVIDIA? Really?? 17%?  Disappointing.  The ethnicity diversity is troubling as well with latino and black.  Amazon is the only company that shows a pretty diverse workforce with regards to race. Ebay, Facebook, flickr and Google, not so much.
