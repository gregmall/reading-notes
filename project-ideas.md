There are a few different directions I was thinking about on this project.  One of them was a site where you could search different vinyl records on a site, getting release info, album cover images and sleave images.  I found an API on discogs.com.  Was also thinking of this same sort of site but instead of just vinyl, it would display recorded discography of a given artist or musical group, displaying album/cd art and all the other info stated above. An api is available from vinyldns.io as well.  Was also talking about an idea of a recipe data base were you could search for recipes by several different criteria (vegan, vegetarian, italian, KETO) and would be presented with a list of recipes matching the given criteria.  Lots of available APIs for a project such as this.  I was originally thinking about an app that gives you real time voter information in your area (candidates, measures, etc) and registration info.  This seems like a pretty difficult thing to achieve.  It would mostly have to be local elections as each state conducts their own elections.  APIs seem to be all over but its an idea.
