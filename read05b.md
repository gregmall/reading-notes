# Problem solving skills
* Be open minded
    - The actual problem you have may be different to the problem you think you have.
    - What you think is causing the problem may not actually be what is causing the problem.
    - The best option may be to throw out your solution and start again in a different direction.
    - Your beliefs on anything and everything could be wrong.

* Be Inquisitive
- BOLO:
    - things that seem odd or stand out.
    - any patterns.
    - anything that is there that maybe shouldn't be.
    - anything that is missing

* Ask the right questions
    - What is it actually doing?
    - How is it actually doing it?
    - How effectively is it performing its purpose?
    - Why is it doing it/ what would happen if it was taken out?
    - What is it's relationship with other components?
    - What could I do to test that assumption?

* Slow down
    - can be difficult to do but can made a big difference

* Don't be lazy
    - Don't be lazy. Read all the material, don't just skim it. Often the difference between something working and not is a little detail you have missed.

* Don't panic
    - When you start looking at a problem and it seems really simple, you don’t really understand the complexity of the problem. Then you get into the problem, and you see that it’s really complicated, and you come up with all these convoluted solutions. That’s sort of the middle, and that’s where most people stop

* Assess the situation
    - either
        - we are fixing a problem
            - need to find as much information as possible to help you work out what has gone wrong and why. Read any error messages carefully. If there is any output, look over it to see if there are any useful clues.
        - we are creating something new
            - should consider what resources you have available to build with. Consider all resources, even if can't see how they would be useful. Sometimes with a bit of creativity you can find great uses for seemingly unneeded resources.

* Create a hypothesis
    - first and foremost, of course

* Rinse and repeat
    - Once you've put your hypothesis into practice you will get a result. If the result is what you were after then great. If not then we need to go back to step 1 and assess the situation.

* Develop this thinking habit
    - A simple way to develop this habit of thinking is to play a game. This game can be played by yourself of with friends. All you need to do is pick a simple everyday item (it could be anything, a shoe or a pen for example) then try and come up with as many different uses as you can for it (beyond it's normal intended usage).

* Break the problem down
    - Break in half
    - identify the easiest thing you can do to get you closer to the solution

* THree solutions
    -  whenever tacking a problem, consider 3 possible ways of solving it.  They should be as diverse as as possible

* Dive in
    - sometimes the best way to start is to dive in and start trying things.  Head first, yo..

# 3 Simple habits to improve your critical thinking
- Question assumptions (the make an ass out of you and me)
    - figure out when to question assumption
    - consider alternatives

- Reason through logic
    - pay close attention to the chain of logic constructed by a particular argument.
    - be aware of common fallacies 

- Diversify thought
    - different people with different backgrounds and life experiences can open up thought.
    - get out of your 'bubble'

# The surprising power of questions
* Don't ask, don't get
    - people tend to hold back
    - squeaky wheel gets the grease
    - another cliche but you know, don't clam up

* New Socratic Method
    - The first step in becoming a better questioner is simply to ask more questions
    - Favor follow up questions
    - Know when to keep questions open ended
    - Get the sequence right
    - Asking tough questions first can make people more willing to open up
    - Use the right tone
    - Pay attention to group dynamics

* Best Response
    - deciding what to share
        - Before a conversation takes place, think carefully about whether refusing to answer tough questions would do more harm than good.
    - deciding what to keep private
        - effective strategy is deflecting, or answering a probing question with another question or a joke. Answerers can use this approach to lead the conversation in a different direction.
* Conclusion
    - QUESTION EVERYTHING thoughtfully, of course
