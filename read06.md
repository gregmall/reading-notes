# What Is Node and WHen Should I Use It?
* What is Node.js
    - Node.js is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Google’s V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library.

* Node is built on google chrome's v8 Javascript Engine
    - it enhances the V8 engine with features such as a file system API, and HTTP library and a number of operating system related utility methods

* Installing Node.js
     - version manager is recommended 
     - install multiple versions of node.js using nvm : https://www.sitepoint.com/quick-tip-multiple-versions-node-nvm/

* Node.js has excellent support for modern javascript
    - you can write your JavaScript using the latest and most modern syntax.
    - you don’t generally have to worry about compatibility issues — as you would if you were writing JavaScript that would run in different browsers

* npm, the javascript package manager
    - the package manager for JavaScript, npm is also the world’s largest software registry.
    - There are over 1,000,000 packages of JavaScript code available to download, with billions of downloads per week

* What is node.js used for?
    - used for anything from bundling your JavaScript files and dependencies into static assets, to running tests, or automatic code linting and style checking

* Node.js lets us run javascript on the server
    - Node now plays a critical role in the technology stack of many high-profile companies
    - node.js execution model
        - node.js is single threaded
        - node.js is **event driven** ie everything that happens in node is ain reaction to an event.

* Downsides to node.js?
    - single threaded nature imposes some limitations.
    - some developers dislike the callback based style of code imposed by javascript

* What kind of apps is node.js suited to?
    - applications that require some form of real-time interaction or collaboration
    - building APIs where you’re handling lots of requests that are I/O driven
    - sites involving data streaming, as Node makes it possible to process files while they’re still being uploaded

* Advantages of Node.js
    - your brain no longer needs to switch modes
    - You can do everything in the same language, which, as a developer, makes you more productive
    - JavaScript is ubiquitous: most of us are familiar with JavaScript, or have used it at some point. This means that transitioning to Node development is potentially easier than to other server-side languages.
