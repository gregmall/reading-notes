# What Google Learned
    - read it in 201 and skimmed it.  Was a good refresher on what is important in team building

# How I explained REST to my brother
* very interesting conversation that explains REST in a way to a non tech person that uses real world metaphors.  Using NOUNS and VERBS to explain how HTTP works and how computers communicate helps to visualize the how it works.  
HTTP is a general purpose protocol for applying 'nouns' to 'verbs'

# SuperAgent
* light-weight progressive ajax API crafted for flexibility, readability and low learning curve.

- lots of technical stuff here.  Skimmed through it.  Kinda makes sense.  Hoping to get some hands-on experience to get a better understanding of it.
