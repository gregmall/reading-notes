# Video Series on Styling HTML5 Forms
This was a pretty cool tutorial.  I feel that I knew most of the material already but the guy had some pretty good tricks.  I especially liked how he placed different images in the text fields that were all of from the same image file just positioned differently in CSS.  The label "for" property corresponding with the input "id" was pretty cool.  Had never seen that before and it seems like it would be quite useful.  The validation of the email and phone number fields that he did in the final video was also very cool. "Required" is a pretty useful HTML 5 addition that simplifies validation of the fields.  Using class 'tick' class that correspond with the adjacent input fields was also a cool technique.  I will bookmark this and reference it going forward.
